    <h2>What is falafel?</h2>
    <p> Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern “fast food” made of a mixture of chickpeas (or fava beans), fresh herbs, and spices that are formed into a small patties or balls.  It’s thought that falafel originated in Egypt as Coptic Christians looked for a hearty replacement for meat during long seasons of fasting or lent.  It has also become a popular vegan food in Egypt and throughout the Middle East.</p>
    <p>This vegan dish is made with simple, everyday ingredients and you won’t believe how easy it is. Great ingredients are key to great falafel so be sure to purchase high quality spices like cumin and coriander for your falafel mixture.</p>
    <p>Now let's make these bad boys!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>1 small onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>3-5 cloves garlic (or how many feels right)</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 tablespoon flour or chickpea flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>One day ahead: Pour the chickpeas into a large bowl and cover them by about 3 inches of cold water. Add 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the water and stir; this will help soften the chickpeas. Cover the bowl and let them soak overnight in a cool, dark place or in the refrigerator. The chickpeas should soak at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours, until tender (change soaking water for fresh water after 12 hours).</p></li>
            <li><p>Drain and rinse the chickpeas well. Pour them into your food processor along with the chopped onion, garlic cloves, parsley, flour or chickpea flour (use chickpea flour to make gluten free), salt, cumin, ground coriander, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom.</p></li>
            <li><p>Pulse all ingredients together until a rough, coarse meal forms. Scrape the sides of the processor periodically and push the mixture down the sides. Process until the mixture is somewhere between the texture of couscous and a paste. You want the mixture to hold together, and a more paste-like consistency will help with that… but don't over-process, you don't want it turning into hummus!</p></li>
            <li><p>Once the mixture reaches the desired consistency, pour it out into a bowl and use a fork to stir; this will make the texture more even throughout. Remove any large chickpea chunks that the processor missed.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat the oil to 180 celsius</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, form falafel mixture into round balls or slider-shaped patties using wet hands or a falafel scoop. </p></li>
            <li><p>When the oil is at the right temperature, fry the falafels in batches of 5-6 at a time until golden brown on both sides. Once the falafels are fried, remove them from the oil using a slotted spoon. Let them drain on paper towels.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve the falafels fresh and hot; they go best with a plate of hummus and topped with creamy tahini sauce. You can also stuff them into a pita.</p></li>
        </ol>
