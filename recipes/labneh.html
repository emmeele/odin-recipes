<h2>What is labneh?</h2>
<p>Labneh is basically: a very thick, creamy, Middle Eastern style yogurt cheese. It has the consistency of American cream cheese, but with a little more flavor, complexity and tang. And of the best part? It has all the healthy probiotics of cultured yogurt. In a nutshell, labneh is creamy dreamy heavenly goodness!  The perfect canvas for all your creative toppings. And I can’t wait to see what you do with this!</p>
<p>Let's make this healthy delicacy!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Full fat whole milk yoghurt</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p>Place a kitchen towel or cheesecloth ( double layer) over a strainer, over a bowl.</p></li>
    <li><p>Salt the yogurt (full fat, plain) and pour it in the towel set over the strainer.</p></li>
    <li><p>Strain the yogurt over the sink.</p></li>
    <li><p>After 24 hours, remove the whey – and then decide if your labneh is thick enough for your liking. Usually, 24 hours is perfect for a “dip”, but sometimes for a thicker, cheese-like version, I’ll let it strain for an additional 24 hours. Up to you.</p></li>
